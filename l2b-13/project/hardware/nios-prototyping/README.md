# Nios Prototyping

Everything in this directory has not been used in the final project.
As part of our iterative design process, our individual components began as individual projects.
So, this directory is dedicated to those little projects that were essential to building up our project as a whole.

Here, you will find the Nios projects for the AR1100 touch controller and the HX711 load cell amplifier + load cell.
